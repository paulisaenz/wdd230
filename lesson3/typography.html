              <h4>
                Heading Font: Roboto Slab Family
              </h4>
              <p>
                The Roboto Slab Family goes along well with the website logo proposed. It has a slab serif, and it makes a difference between the headings and the reading text.
              </p>
        
              <h4>
                Paragraph Font: Roboto Sans Serif Family
              </h4>
              <p>
                It's always good to keep it simple. The chosen family font is the Roboto Sans Serif. It goes well with the Roboto Slab Family, chosen before for headings because they were made by the same creator. For the topic this web page will cover, the sans serif font will be the best for reading on the internet.
